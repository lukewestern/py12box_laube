# Inputs and outputs of box model for minor CFCs
Emissions for minor CFCs

This repo provides input data to derive global emissions and mole fractions for minor CFCs to 
accompany the paper "Increasing global abundances of five ozone-depleting CFCs from 2010-2020",
Western et al., submitted.

All outputs from the box model used in the paper are also included in this repo.

Note that the box model and inverse routine are contained in the repos:
[AGAGE 12-box model](https://github.com/mrghg/py12box) and
[AGAGE 12-box model inversion](https://github.com/mrghg/py12box_invert)

Emissions and modelled mole fraction estimates for CFC-112, CFC-112a, CFC-113, CFC-113a, CFC-114 and CFC-114a are in the folder /data/. Inputs to the model are within the folder for each gas (each gas contains the folders /inputs/ and /outputs/. These gases are derived using measurements analysed by UEA/FZJ.

Emissions and modelled mole fraction estimates for CFC-13 and CFC-115 are in the folder /data_allagage/. Inputs to the model are within the folder for each gas (each gas contains the folders /inputs/ and /outputs/. These gases are derived using measurements made as part of the AGAGE network.
